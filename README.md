## Why use it?

This list was put together by instructors, mentors, and members of the SDCND slack channel to prepare incoming students of the SDCND program. The recommended resources are not manditory, 
the important thing is that students have sufficient knowledge of the topics mentioned.

"In a perfect world, incoming students would have:
Intermediate Python (Numpy, Classes)
Intermediate C++ (Memory Allocation, References, Classes)
Basic Linear Algebra (Matrix Multiplication)
Basic Calculus (Derivatives, Integrals)
Basic Statistics (Mean, Standard Deviation, Probability, Distributions)
Basic Physics (Velocity, Torque, Forces)"
- David Silver, Self-Driving Car Lead (Udacity)

## How to use it

Everything below is an outline, though the content is not listed in any particular order. Some areas have multiple resources covering the same topic, so choosing one of the resources is sufficient. I suggest reading the syllabus and watching a lecture or two to see which resource seems better suited for your learning style.

I'm using Github's special markdown flavor, including tasks lists to check progress.

- [x] Create a new branch so you can check items to record your progress. Just put an x in the brackets: [x]
